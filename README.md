# Project Readme

## Overview

This project is built using the [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) library along with Vite, React, and TypeScript. It showcases a Date Range Selector component that allows users to select a range between two dates.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can check if it's installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate into the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Environment**

   Start the development server using:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will run the project in development mode, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the Vite configuration).

### Building for Production

1. **Create a Production Build**

   To generate the production-ready build, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will compile and optimize the project files for production.

2. **Preview the Production Build**

   To preview the production build, use:

   ```bash
   npx vite preview
   ```

   This will start a local server to serve the production build, allowing you to test the final output before deployment.

## Features

- **Date Range Selector**: A component to select a range between two dates.
